/**
 * This package holds all of the controllers for this game. A controller is synonymous with the controllers from a MVC
 * design scheme, where classes deal with the logic and implementation details of the systems they support. This is
 * useful as instead of the functionality of a certain feature being spread across multiple classes, it can be localised
 * into one specific class, where all the models and views can get their implementation from.
 *
 * This class specifically holds things such as the different UI controllers (MenuController, HostController,
 * ClientController), as well as things such as the SceneManager and the ObjectManager. As well as these, this package
 * also contains the input based classes too. This consists of the main Input class used for dealing with input in the
 * game loop as well as the keyboard and mouse listeners for the game scene too.
